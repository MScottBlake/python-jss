### 0.5.7 (March 17, 2015) Corned Beef and Cabbage

FIXES:

- Mounted distribution points ```is_mounted``` method now looks for mounted shares by server, and updates mount point dynamically if it is different than configured. This prevents issues when multiple shares have the same name, or when Casper Admin is open and has mounted them already, with different-than-expected share names. Thanks @eahrold!
- Mounted distribution points ```__repr__``` corrected to make use of ```is_mounted```.

CHANGES:

- Adds ```tlsadapter.py``` to subclass ```requests.HTTPAdapter``` into using ```PROTOCOL_TLSv1```. Removes need for manually editing each requests release.
- Updates requests to 2.5.3
- Adds in extra LDAPServer methods.
	- ```search_users()``` searches for users.
	- ```search_groups()``` searches for groups.
	- ```is_user_in_group()``` tests for group membership by user.
- Mounted repositories' ```umount``` now has a ```forced``` argument which defaults to ```True```.
- Mounted repositories' ```mount_point```, due to the dynamic handling above, is no longer made by concatenating the repo name or "JSS" and share name. Thanks @eahrold!
- Remove unused requests import in distribution_points.

### 0.5.6 (March 6, 2015) Tonkatsu

FIXES:

- Solve regression in JSS >= 9.64 FileUpload API call failing on icon upload with Tomcat Java exception by shelling out to curl.
- Add ```list_type``` for ```jss.Site``` so it will properly add itself to other objects. Thanks @MScottBlake. (#29)

### 0.5.5 (February 2, 2015) Sanpo Shimasu

FIXES:

- Automatically configured distribution points (AFP and SMB shares using just name and password) need to pass jss object so ```jss_migrated``` is handled correctly. (sheagcraig/JSSImporter#19)

CHANGES:

- Added ```jss.distribution_points.DistributionPoints.delete()``` and ```jss.distribution_points.MountedRepository.delete()```
- Added ```jss.distribution_points.JDS.delete()``` and ```jss.distribution_points.JDS.delete_with_casperAdminSave()```. The latter is the method used by the Casper Admin app, and is included mostly for reference.
- Refactored redundent filetype checking to ```jss.distribution_points.is_package()``` and ```jss.distribution_points.is_script()```.

### 0.5.4 (January 29, 2015) Apex Predator

FIXES:

- ```distribution_points.DistributionPoint``` did not have ```id_``` arguments.
- Whitespace cleanup.
- Migrated JSS with AFP or SMB shares now correctly copies scripts to DB instead of fileshare.
- AFP and SMB distribution points should require ```share_name``` argument.
- Standardized ```id_```'s in ```distribution_points``` to be ints.

### 0.5.3 (December 9, 2014) Dress For Success

FIXES:

- Non-flat packages cannot be uploaded to JDS'. Now there is a warning message and documentation. (#20)
- If you haven't configured any DP's through the ```repo_prefs``` parameter to the ```JSS```, we shouldn't attempt ```DistributionPoints.retrieve_all()```. Reordered slightly to avoid problems. (#21)
	- No need (unnecessary work)
	- Your API user may not have permissions to do so! Thanks @arubdesu

CHANGES:

- Added script testing to ```jss.distribution_points.JDS.exists```.
- Tests updated.
- Moved all exceptions to their own module.
- Added an exception for attempting to upload non-flat packages.
- Added '.ZIP' as a package file type.
- Added ```suppress_warnings``` parameter to ```jss.JSS``` objects to disable urllib3 warnings. Use at your own risk. (sheagcraig/jss-autopkg-addon#18)

### 0.5.2 (December 5, 2014) Brass Monkey

FIXES:

- JDS copy methods were not utilizing the same session as everything else and did not honor SSL settings. Corrected. (#18)

CHANGES:

- Started working on the nosetests again. This doesn't directly affect users; however, it should help me prevent regressions and should help automate testing things across a variety of different JSS/DistributionPoint types.

### 0.5.1 (December 4, 2014) Gold Soundz

FIXES:

- Finally implementing @ocoda suggestions for solving the disabling of SSL in >= JSS  v9.61. (sheagcraig/jss-autopkg-addon#9, #16) #Further behind-the-scenes-measures are being investigated to streamline this edit for the future.
- Fixed ```list_type``` for ```ActivationCode``` regression.
- Fixed DistributionPoints __init__ mistake.

CHANGES:

- Configuration for a JDS has changed. Now it only requires key: type, value: JDS. See the [wiki](https://github.com/sheagcraig/python-jss/wiki/Configuration) for complete examples.
	- Old configuration was misleading and/or redundent. Uploading to a JDS actually involves POSTing to the *JSS*, using the JSS' URL, and a correctly privileged API user, NOT the JDS' URL or WebDAV R/W accounts.
- Implemented missing API objects:
	- BYOProfile
	- ComputerConfiguration
	- IBeacon. PEP8 wins over Apple 'iFoolishness' for naming.
	- MacApplication
	- VPPAccount

### 0.4.4 (December 3, 2014) Welcome to the Terrordome

FIXES:

- Included submodules should now properly handle TLS for JSS v9.6.1 or later. (sheagcraig/jss-autopkg-addon#9, #16)
- ```JSSObject.save()``` has been reworked to safely handle all permutations of PUT and POST abilities on objects. For example, ```ComputerInvitations``` can only POST, not PUT, and did not work correctly.
- All tests in the test suite are passing again. This is of course set up to work on our testing server only.

CHANGES:

- ```JSS``` objects will now have a ```DistributionPoint``` property ```JSS.distribution_points``` even if no repos are configured. This makes it easier to add in after the fact.
- Updated [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/) to 2.5.0.
- ```JSSObject.save()``` now has better error reporting.

KNOWN ISSUES:

- See #15. Objects that can potentially have a category, but have none, fail to save. This is almost certainly related to how the JSS interprets the changed value of nil categories (was "Unknown", now "No category assigned"). This has been solved by overriding the ```save``` method on Policies and Packages until they fix it. Please let me know if you come across others.

### 0.4.3 (December 1, 2014) Anti-Corruption Sauce

FIXES:

- JDS repos can now upload packages and scripts. Thanks to @beckf for sorting out the dark magic in the packets. (#5)

CHANGES:

- Identified eBooks as file type 1 and in mobile apps as file type 2 for dbfileupload parameters. This may not be the appropriate place to house these functions, but for those who need it, the JDS._copy() method can now upload eBooks and mobile apps. Please feel free to experiment and clue me in to how to make it work better.
- Research also showed that there are two viable methods for uploading to a JDS. We will stick with the existing method for the time being.

### 0.4.2 (November 25, 2014) Eyebrow Floss

I did a quick update to include an egg installer on pypi.org. This was needed to support the jss-autopkg-addon installer.

CHANGES:

- AFP and SMB shares' URL variable should not include a prefixed protocol. Now, python-jss removes any preceding afp:// or smb:// from URL preferences just to be safe. Thanks @eahrold. (#13)

FIXES:

- Repos input variables ```port``` and ```domain``` were incorrectly pulled from preferences. This has been corrected. Thanks @eahrold. (sheagcraig/jss-autopkg-addon#11)

### 0.4.1 (November 25, 2014) Postpartum Fixapalooza

CHANGES:

- Updates bundled Requests to 2.4.3.
- Mounted repositories now use the force flag to unmount. If this troubles anyone, let me know and I'll make it an option. (#10)

FIXES:

- AFP and SMB file shares did not properly escape password characters. Thanks @eahrold for the fix. (#4)
- AFP shares were defaulting to the incorrect port (139). Now defaults to 548. Thanks @eahrold again! (#8)
- Requests module not properly referenced in jss.py and distribution_points.py. Big props to @eahrold. (#7)
- SSLv3 support was dropped in JSS v9.61 to avoid the Poodle attack. Thanks to @ocoda for a solution while we waited for urllib3 (part of requests) to update to solve this problem. (#6)
- Explicitly configured AFP and SMB sharepoints, despite the documentation, needed a ```name```. This is now properly set as optional. If left out, a generic name with an incremented numeric suffix will be used.

KNOWN ISSUES:

- JDS distribution points can upload scripts and packages, but they are getting corrupted with HTML multipart boundaries because the requests are not being made quite right. This should be solved soon.

### 0.4 (November 2, 2014) Mayonnaise-Olive Parfait

ADDITIONS:

- Adds class ```casper```. This class pulls the information returned from POSTing to the undocumented casper.jxml. At some point I would like this to allow for automatic configuration of all repository information (provided an authentication by a privileged user). However, due to its undocumented nature, I don't want to rely on it until I can get some confirmation from JAMF that this is 'OK'.
- Adds class ```JDS``` to module ```distribution_points```. (#1)
	- Can copy packages/DMG's.
	- Can copy scripts, although it is currently broken.
		- Scripts include HTML form boundaries... Working on this.
	- Has a limited .exists() method.
	- Has a more thorough .exists_with_casper() method that uses the undocumented casper.jxml/casper-module.
- class ```DistributionPoints``` now adds ```JDS``` type DP's.
- ```DistributionPoints``` now have helper methods to add and remove a ```DistributionPoint```.

KNOWN ISSUES:

- JDS distribution points can upload scripts and packages, but they are getting corrupted with HTML multipart boundaries because the requests are not being made quite right. This should be solved soon.

CHANGES:

- ```DistributionPoints.__repr__``` factored into ```DistributionPoint``` and children.
- New option to fully declare distribution point connection information in the preference file or at JSS or DistributionPoints instantiation time.
	- Shares will now only be included if they are defined in the list of ```repos```. (Previously, it would try to match all DP's from .distributionpoints to a config option).
	- AFP or SMB shares declared in the previous style, with just a ```name``` and ```password``` will still get the rest of the information from the server.
	- You may now specify these connection properties explictly.
	- JDS' must be configured with explicit properties.
	- See docstrings for the different types of DistributionPoint for required keys.
- DistributionPoint subclasses will now let you know what config information you left out.
- DistributionPoints and DistributionPoint subclasses now have an optional argument id_ for supporting JDS copy methods.
	- Ignored by non-JDS DP's.
	- Can be used to copy a package/script to an existing package object rather than creating a new one (the default, of -1 makes a new object).
- Moved documentation from README to wiki.

### 0.3.11 (October 8, 2014) Offal Sliders 2

FIXES:

- Except I screwed it up. *Now* ```FileUploads``` is squared away.

### 0.3.10 (October 8, 2014) Offal Sliders

FIXES:

- ```FileUploads``` were sent using a non-session request because I couldn't get it working with a session. I got it working with a session.
- ```FileUploads``` non-session request lacked the verify parameter, thus, even if SSL verification was turned off in the JSS object, it still tried to verify SSL.

### 0.3.9 (September 3, 2014) Chorizo

FIXES:

- Fix resource name when using ```FileUpload```. Previous behavior was to give resource the full upload path as a name. Switched to just os.path.basename()

ADDITIONS:

- Add method ```DistributionPoints.exists()``` for testing for the existence of a script/pkg across all distribution points.

### 0.3.7 (August 29, 2014) Hot Dog Sundae

ADDITIONS:

- Add module ```distribution_points```. Provides:
  - ```DistributionPoints``` to handle copying packages and scripts across all configured repositories.
	- Distribution points are automatically configured (except for password until I can figure out the hashing) based on your JSS's data.
	- copy copies a file to the directory indicated by the file extension (.pkg, .dmg to Packages, everything else to Scripts) of all distribution points.
	- copy_pkg copies a .pkg or .dmg to the Packages directory of all distribution points.
	- copy_script copies a script to the Scripts directory of all distribution points.
	- Distribution points are mounted prior to copy operations if they aren't already.
  - ```AFPRepository```, ```SMBRepository```, ```HTTPRepository```, ```HTTPSRepository```, and ```JDSRepository```. (Only AFP and SMB implemented currently-HTTP(S) and JDS coming soon.)
	- mount (Has option to mount -o nobrowse, so disk doesn't appear in GUI)
	- umount

CHANGES:

- Add handling of ```repos``` preference key in com.github.sheagcraig.python-jss.plist. See README.
- JSS objects now have a DistributionPoint property included at init time, so you don't need to instantiate one. Just delegate!

### 0.3.5 (August 21, 2014) Retcon Cheese Sauce

CHANGES:

- Implemented FileUpload. They are kind of unique in the way they operate, so check the docstring for more info.

### 0.3.4 (August 8, 2014)

NOTES:

- The interface will stay the same now. Only new features and fixes from here on out.

CHANGES:

- Add ```__version__``` property to module. Use for version checking if needed.

### 0.3.3 (July 31, 2014)

CHANGES:

- Reorganized ```JSSObject.save()``` logic to try to update first. Trying to create a new object first with existing objects results in a name conflict exception, which you then have to catch. But when you DO have a name conflict, you really would like to know. This saves the need to wrap save calls in a try/except for updating existing objects. E.g. batch_scope verb of jss_helper.

### 0.3.2 (July 29, 2014)

FIXES:

- Fixed error where pypi packages did not include the cacert.pem file included with requests.

### 0.3.1 (July 17, 2014)

CHANGES:

- ```JSS._error_handler()``` now adds a ```status_code``` attribute to exceptions.

FIXES:

- ```JSSObject.save()``` was confusing. If you created a new object with
  ```JSSObject()``` that conflicted with an existing object on the JSS, the save
  would fail with a ```JSSPutError```. Now we check for conflicts and instead return
  a ```JSSPostError``` with a more helpful error message.
- I mistakenly listed the preference key as ```jss_password``` in the README. Now the code and README agree: ```jss_pass``` is the correct key.

### 0.3 (July 3, 2014)

CHANGES:

- Removed Templates and XMLEditor classes.
  - All editor behaviors / methods moved into appropriate JSSObject subclasses.
  - For example, Policies gain all of their previously inherited PolicyEditor methods.
  - Templates' __init__ methods have become the new() method on objects.
  - Only implemented the existing set of: Category, ComputerGroup, MobileDeviceGroup, Package, Policy
  - SearchCriteria remains an object, although no longer inherits from a template.
- Renamed ```JSSObject.update()``` to ```JSSObject.save()``` to represent its added responsibilities (it can now post new objects as well)
- Creating new objects has changed as a result
  - To create an object now, use the class constructor with the string argument "name", configure as before, and then save().
  - i.e.
    ```
	policy = Policy(jss_instance, "Install Adventure")  
	policy.save()
    ```

### 0.2.2 (July 2, 2014)

ADDITIONS:

- ```jss_helper``` now has a promotion feature... Except see CHANGES below.

CHANGES:

- ```XMLEditor.add_object_to_list()``` now returns the element added.
- ```JSSObject.update()``` now accepts a template as a parameter (defaults to None) to replace instance's data from a template.
- Removing ```jss_helper``` to its own project, here: https://github.com/sheagcraig/jss_helper

FIXES:

- ```XMLEditor.add_object_to_list()``` fixed.
- ```PolicyEditor.add_package()``` fixed.
- ```JSSObject.update()``` did not properly update instance's data.

### 0.2.1 (June 25, 2014)

ADDITIONS:

- Adds ```TemplateFromFile``` and ```TemplateFromString``` classes for using external template files and strings.
- Adds batch_scope feature to jss_helper.

CHANGES:

- Added requests and FoundationPlist to contrib folder of package. No longer need separate installation.
- Should now "just work" even if PyObjC/Foundation are not available. (See end of README).
- Renamed the default preferences file to reference github.

FIXES:

- Should not see SSL handshake errors now. JSS object now has a requests.Session object which prevents having to continually renegotiate. Bonus: It seems to be significantly faster as a result.

ISSUES:

- Requests does not automatically handle SNI out of the box for python 2.x. README describes necessary steps to work around this if needed. Thanks to Greg Neagle for pointing this out.

### 0.2.0 (June 18, 2014)

FEATURES:

- Initial release.
